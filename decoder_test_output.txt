=== TESTING @ TO SPACE CONVERSION IN DECODER ===

--- Testing CRANE VESTA NMEA ---
NMEA 1:!AIVDM,2,1,,A,55U59T000003<EL?H00=84pD1HE=@400000000000000000000000000000000,0*19
Decoded Type:5
Decoded Call Sign:3E
Decoded Vessel Name:WC6  CRANE VESTA
Vessel Name contains @:0

--- Testing with working NMEA example ---
Working NMEA:!AIVDM,1,1,,A,55M8J2@1T>HO@=@0000000000,0*26
Decoded Type:15866936
Decoded Call Sign:
Decoded Vessel Name:
Vessel Name contains @:0

=== CONCLUSION ===
If vessel names still contain '@' symbols after decoding,
then the fix at line 616 in aivdoencoder.cpp might not be working correctly.
Otherwise, the issue might be elsewhere in the display chain.
